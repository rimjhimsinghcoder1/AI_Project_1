AI_Project_1 – End-to-End Recommendation System with Flask API

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning recommendation system suitable for e-commerce or content platforms. It covers synthetic data generation, rule-based and collaborative filtering algorithms, and real-time model deployment using a Flask REST API.

Features
1. Synthetic Data Generation

Simulates realistic user interactions using the Faker library, including product clicks and purchase decisions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzes user behaviour to identify:

Most-clicked products

Purchase conversion rates

User preference patterns

3. Rule-Based Recommendation Engine

Recommends the Top 5 most-clicked products using click frequency as the ranking metric.

4. Collaborative Filtering (SVD)

Implements a matrix factorization model using the surprise library for personalized recommendations.

5. Model Evaluation

Evaluates collaborative filtering performance using RMSE on a train/test split.

6. Flask REST API

Deploys the recommendation system through an endpoint:
GET /recommend?user_id=<id>
Returns real-time recommendations in JSON format.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Faker

scikit-surprise

Flask

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Deployment: Local Flask server (extendable to cloud hosting platforms such as AWS, GCP, Azure).

How It Works
1. Data Simulation

Generates interaction logs for 100 users across 20 products.

2. Analysis & Recommendation Logic

Popularity-based recommendation (rule-based)

Personalized recommendation using SVD collaborative filtering

3. API Deployment

The trained model and rule-based system are served through a Flask API to provide real-time recommendations based on user history.
